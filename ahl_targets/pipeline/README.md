- `coefficients.py` runs linear regressions of energy density and NPM scores and saves coefficient tables
- `model_data.py` generates the source data for the main model
- `npm_robustness.py` generates the source data for the robustness checks
- `simulation_ed.py` energy density model
- `simulation_hfss.py` HFSS model
- `simulation_npm.py` NPM model
